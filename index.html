                    Hi there! My name is Chris Davis! I am very excited to showcase what I have learned in two weeks of coding school!
                    I am very eager to see where this adventure takes me. 
                    <br>
                    <brA few things about myself are that I am happily married to my beautiful wife katelyn,
                    I enjoy spending my freetime playing various video games and learning more about HTML, CSS and JavaScript!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Now if you look below you will find many wonderful projects that I have been working on diligently over my fullstack bootcamp!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Also you will find my beautiful bulldog Pepper sticking her tongue out at me ðŸ˜œ
