## Welcome to my Portfolio!
My name is Chris Davis and I appriciate you taking your time to check out my portfolio!

First off I would like to state that this was quite the adventure starting this project
from scratch! I definitely spent plenty of time rubbing my forehead trying to figure out how to consolidate CSS lines and to make them function. FUN FACT! I spent an hour wondering why my images wouldnt be 1200x900px giant monsters on my page, turns out I typed my href for the style.css incorrectly. Go figure.

## I would like to start with a list of things I learned on this project.
<ul>
    <li>I learned how to apply various formatting styles together being grid and flex through CSS and make them interchange seemlessly to fit the various screen sizes.</li> 
    <li>I solidified my knowledge in making a functioning nav bar and threw in some pseudo-element box shadows for fun.</li>
    <li>I also greatly increased my working knowledge of class and id tags and how to appropriately implement them</li>
</ul>

## Functions of my App
<ul>
    <li>The nav bar will display a box-shadow when hovering over a selector element</li>
    <li>The nav bar elements will redirrect you to the part of the page tied to it</li>
    <li>My Work section has functioning buttons that will redirrect you to a new page being one of my other projects</li>
    <li>My Work buttons also will enlarge and have a box-shadow display while hovering</li>
    <li>Contact Me section has functioning links that will help you get in touch with me!, the phone number is fake.</li>
    <li>The App will reformat to column style once the screen size is less than or equal to 768px</li>
</ul>

## Future improvements/updates
<ul>
    <li>I would love to get my nav bar to be sticky to the top of the page as you scroll.</li>
    <li>I will be creating more projects to add to My Work buttons</li>
    <li>I am aware that the Pseudo Elements Display link is a broken page, I will be working to fix this shortly!</li>
